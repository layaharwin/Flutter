# Flutter App

## Question:
```For the Flutter check, this is the task:
A new flutter app that contains 3 pages with a navigation bar on the bottom that uses either a navigation route or state, you can choose any icons you want for the navigation bar, When clicking on an icon of the navigation bar, it has to redirect the user to theproper page

Here’s more info for the pages:
• First-page “Feed”:
  o Have a list view builder with some asset and or network Images that we can scroll
  o You have to handle the scrollview
• Second page “Post”:
  o This page has to have a form with a textformfield input and a button that add to a list the text entered in the input
  o All the text added to the list has to be displayed on the screen and handled by a scrollview
• Third page "Profile":
  o You must design a profile page with a custom image and information §It has to contain an image, first name, last name, age, and basic info of your choice

To recap you must do ONLY the front of the app, there are only 3 pages in this app and no authentication must be done. For the design and the color, you can do whatever you want!
```
